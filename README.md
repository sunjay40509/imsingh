A student and faculty can issue books. Different limits for number of books a student and teacher can issue. Also the number of days will be different in case of students and teachers for issue any book.  Each book will have different ID. Also each book of same name and same author (but number of copies) will have different ID. Entry of all the book will be done, who issue that book and when and also duration. Detail of Fine(when book not returned at time) is also stored.  As per API usage,  I can use information on books details like category, author name, isbn, edition year etc.
